## 🌟 Inspiration

This website is inspired by my passion for meaningful projects that positively impact communities. Bringing quality education to rural areas through a modern, engaging platform felt like a project worth every line of code. Just as in *One Piece*, I’m driven by making a difference through small, purposeful steps—one project at a time.

## ⚽ A Bit About Me

When I'm not building websites, I’m usually:
- **Playing Football** with my school team (where every match is an adventure)
- **Experimenting with Science Projects** to solve real-world problems, like affordable water filters for communities in Bangladesh
- **Watching Anime** (currently into *Aoashi*) to stay inspired
